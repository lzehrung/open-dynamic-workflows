/**
 * Workspace isolation via git worktrees (cross-cutting).
 *
 * Each `agent` call runs against a *workspace*. Two modes:
 *   - `inplace` (default): the agent runs directly in the source directory —
 *     the same semantics as Claude Code's Workflow tool subagents. No isolation,
 *     no diff.
 *   - `worktree` (per-agent opt-in via `isolation: "worktree"`): the agent runs
 *     in a throwaway `git worktree` of the source repository — again the same
 *     mechanism Claude Code uses. Worktrees share the repo's object store, so
 *     setup is near-free regardless of tree size. The agent's changes come back
 *     as a unified diff against the commit the worktree started from — staging
 *     or even committing inside the worktree does not hide work — and the
 *     worktree is removed afterwards; the diff is the artifact.
 *
 * Known properties of the git mechanism (shared with Claude Code's worktrees):
 *   - the source must be a git repository with at least one commit; asking for
 *     isolation elsewhere fails that agent call with an actionable error
 *   - the worktree is a clean checkout of the base commit — the agent sees the
 *     last commit, not any uncommitted edits in the source tree
 *   - submodules are NOT initialised (their directories are empty), and
 *     absolute symlinks are checked out verbatim — a link that points back
 *     into the source tree escapes the isolation if the agent writes through it
